# The-Snake-AI
**Project Overview:**
This project develops an Artificial Intelligence controller which competes against the famous Snake game. Through pathfinding algorithms together with reinforcement learning principles the AI system performs intelligent decisions while simultaneously maximizing scoring ability and wall boundary maintenance. The project analyzes artificial intelligence-driven play optimization approaches to demonstrate their abilities in enhancing gameplay.

**Features:**
Classic Snake Gameplay: This game functions while the Python pygame library provides its visual representation.
**AI Integration:**
Pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A*, BFS).
The implementation includes reinforcement learning with examples of Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks.
**Dynamic Gameplay:** The system adopts live updates to find its best possible scoring options.
Customizable Settings: Both snake velocity parameters and AI adaptation capabilities and grid dimensions become customizable for research purposes.
**Tech Stack**
**Programming Language: **Python
**Libraries Used:**
pygame (for game rendering)
numpy (for numerical computations)
matplotlib (for optional visualization of training data or performance)
**How the AI Works**

Environment Setup:

Snake manifests as an environmental structure containing states that represent snake position along with food position and walls.
AI systems collect environmental data then process this data through established algorithms to create decisions.
AI Logic:

Pathfinding: Shortest food paths are determined through the implementation of A* or BFS algorithms.

**Reinforcement Learning:**
The snake uses Q-Learning algorithms for training together with optional Deep Q-Network implementations.
An AI system receives rewards upon eating food items and suffers penalties for accident-caused collisions.

**Reward System:**

Positive Reward: Eating food.
Negative Reward: Collisions with walls or the snake's body.
